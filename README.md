# Subreddit-populator
This is a lightweight python script aimed at continually populating a subreddit with content. It works by creating a stream of new posts and analyzing the titles for keywords. Once a post is selected from the stream, the content link is posted to the target subreddit with the original title. The script also makes a comment of the new post saying that the post was made by a bot.
